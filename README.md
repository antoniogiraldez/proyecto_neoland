# proyecto_neoland
Final project made for the NEOLAND Data Science Bootcamp. The script is part of the code used for roof segmentation of aerial imagery. The Dataset was provided by https://www.airs-dataset.com/ to whom I am grateful. 
In the script is the code for preprocessing the images and building a U-NET with keras. Also some conclusions and areas of improvements are mentioned.
